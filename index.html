  <header>Introduction to SASS</header>
  <p id="intro">Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more,
     all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within
     and across projects.</p>
  <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
  <p>CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor
     can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies
     that make writing CSS fun again.</p>
  <p>Once you start tinkering with Sass, it will take your preprocessed Sass file and save it as a normal CSS file that you can use in
     your website.</p>
  <p>The most direct way to make this happen is in your terminal. Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS
     using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to. For example,
     running sass input.scss output.css from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.</p>
  <p>You can also watch individual files or directories with the --watch flag. The watch flag tells Sass to watch your source files for changes,
     and re-compile CSS each time you save your Sass. If you wanted to watch (instead of manually build) your input.scss file, you'd just add
     the watch flag to your command, like so:</p>
     <code>sass --watch input.scss output.css</code>
